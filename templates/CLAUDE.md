  - **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - favor simple, readable solutions
  - **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - implement only what's needed now
  - **Minimal Dependencies** - prefer native solutions, avoid unnecessary libraries
  - **Pragmatic Decisions** - choose the simplest solution that works
- **Code Style**:
  - **Minimal emojis**: Use plain text (prefer chars like ✓ ✗ > \*)
